# ðŸ”” Notification Subscription Fix

## Problem Fixed:

**Error**: "tried to subscribe multiple times. 'subscribe' can only be called a single time per channel instance"

## Root Cause:

The `useNotifications` hook was creating multiple subscriptions to the same Supabase channel without properly cleaning up previous subscriptions. This happened because:

1. The cleanup was using `supabase.removeChannel()` instead of `channel.unsubscribe()`
2. The subscribing flag wasn't properly preventing multiple subscription attempts
3. The channel name was using a timestamp making it unique each time, preventing proper cleanup

## Fixes Applied:

### âœ… **1. Proper Subscription Cleanup**

- Changed from `supabase.removeChannel()` to `channel.unsubscribe()`
- Fixed all cleanup functions to use the correct unsubscribe method

### âœ… **2. Better Subscription Prevention**

- Enhanced the `subscribingRef` flag to prevent multiple subscription attempts
- Added check for existing subscription before creating new one
- Removed timestamp from channel name to allow proper cleanup

### âœ… **3. Improved Error Handling**

- Added proper error state when subscription setup fails
- Reset subscribing flag on all error conditions
- Better logging for debugging subscription issues

### âœ… **4. Enhanced Cleanup on Unmount**

- Proper cleanup of subscriptions when component unmounts
- Reset all flags on cleanup
- Clear timeouts and intervals properly

## Code Changes:

### Before:

```typescript
// Problematic: Used removeChannel instead of unsubscribe
supabase.removeChannel(subscriptionRef.current);

// Problematic: Timestamp made channels unique, preventing cleanup
const channelName = `notifications_${user.id}_${Date.now()}`;

// Problematic: Didn't check for existing subscription
if (subscribingRef.current) {
  return;
}
```

### After:

```typescript
// Fixed: Use proper unsubscribe method
subscriptionRef.current.unsubscribe();

// Fixed: Consistent channel naming
const channelName = `notifications_${user.id}`;

// Fixed: Check both subscribing flag AND existing subscription
if (subscribingRef.current || subscriptionRef.current) {
  return;
}
```

## Benefits:

- âœ… No more multiple subscription errors
- âœ… Proper resource cleanup prevents memory leaks
- âœ… Better error handling and recovery
- âœ… More reliable real-time notifications
- âœ… Improved performance with proper cleanup

## Testing:

The notification system should now work properly without subscription errors. You can test by:

1. Logging in/out multiple times
2. Navigating between pages
3. Checking browser console for subscription logs
4. Verifying notifications work in real-time

The error "tried to subscribe multiple times" should no longer occur.
