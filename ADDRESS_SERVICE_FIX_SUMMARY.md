# Address Service Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved

**PostgreSQL Error PGRST116**: "JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned" when fetching user addresses.

## Root Cause

The `getUserAddresses` function was using `.single()` which expects exactly one row, but new users don't have address records yet, resulting in 0 rows and triggering an error.

## Error Details

```
Error: JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned (PGRST116)
Code: PGRST116
Details: The result contains 0 rows
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. 🔧 Fixed getUserAddresses Function

**Before:**

```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("profiles")
  .select("pickup_address, shipping_address, addresses_same")
  .eq("id", userId)
  .single(); // ❌ Throws error if no rows found
```

**After:**

```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("profiles")
  .select("pickup_address, shipping_address, addresses_same")
  .eq("id", userId)
  .maybeSingle(); // ✅ Returns null if no rows found

// Return default structure if no profile data exists
return (
  data || {
    pickup_address: null,
    shipping_address: null,
    addresses_same: false,
  }
);
```

### 2. 🔧 Fixed saveUserAddresses Function

Also updated to use `.maybeSingle()` with proper null handling for consistency.

### 3. 📋 Verified Existing Code Compatibility

Confirmed that all consuming components already use safe navigation:

- ✅ `Profile.tsx` - Uses `addressData?.pickup_address`
- ✅ `SellerValidationService.ts` - Uses `addressDetails?.pickup_address`
- ✅ `ComprehensiveQAChecker.tsx` - Uses `addresses?.pickup_address?.streetAddress`

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified

- `src/services/addressService.ts` - Updated both functions to use `.maybeSingle()`

### Files Created

- `src/utils/addressServiceTest.ts` - Debug utility for testing address functionality
- `ADDRESS_SERVICE_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Technical Details

### maybeSingle() vs single()

- **`.single()`**: Expects exactly 1 row, throws error if 0 or >1 rows
- **`.maybeSingle()`**: Returns null if 0 rows, data if 1 row, error if >1 rows

### Default Return Structure

When no address data exists, the service now returns:

```typescript
{
  pickup_address: null,
  shipping_address: null,
  addresses_same: false
}
```

## Benefits

### 🚀 User Experience

- New users can access profile page without errors
- Graceful handling of empty address states
- No breaking errors during initial setup

### 🛠️ Developer Experience

- Clear error logging with context
- Debug utility for testing address functionality
- Consistent null handling across the application

### 🔧 Maintainability

- Robust error handling for edge cases
- Defensive programming approach
- Clear data structure contracts

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **New User Flow**: Create new account → access profile → should load without errors
2. **Address Setup**: Add addresses → verify they save and load correctly
3. **Address Validation**: Test seller validation with/without addresses

### Development Testing

```typescript
// Available in dev mode
window.testAddressService("user-id-here");
```

### Edge Cases to Test

- User with no profile record
- User with empty address fields
- User with complete address information
- Network errors during address loading

## Deployment Notes

After deploying this fix:

1. Monitor for any remaining PGRST116 errors
2. Test new user onboarding flow
3. Verify seller validation works correctly
4. Check profile page loads for all user types

The address service is now robust and handles the normal case where new users don't have addresses set up yet.
