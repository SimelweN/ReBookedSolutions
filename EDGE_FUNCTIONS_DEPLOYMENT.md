# Edge Functions Deployment Guide

## Current Status

The commit system is now working with **local fallback functionality**. This means:

- ✅ **Commit to Sale** works even without Edge Functions deployed
- ✅ **Decline Order** functionality added
- ✅ All commit features work locally through direct database operations
- ⚠️ Edge Functions provide enhanced features but are optional

## What Works Now (Local Fallback)

1. **Commit to Sale** - Full functionality with database updates, notifications, and book status changes
2. **Decline Order** - New feature to reject orders with buyer notification
3. **Real-time Updates** - Live subscription to pending commits
4. **Error Handling** - Graceful fallback when Edge Functions aren't available

## Optional: Deploy Edge Functions for Enhanced Features

If you want to deploy the Edge Functions for enhanced functionality:

### Prerequisites

1. Supabase CLI installed: `npm install -g supabase`
2. Supabase project with database setup
3. Service role key configured

### Deployment Steps

1. **Login to Supabase CLI:**

   ```bash
   supabase login
   ```

2. **Link your project:**

   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
   ```

3. **Deploy Edge Functions:**

   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy commit-to-sale
   supabase functions deploy auto-expire-commits
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   ```bash
   supabase secrets set SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   supabase secrets set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   ```

5. **Set up cron job for auto-expire (optional):**
   ```sql
   -- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor
   SELECT cron.schedule('auto-expire-commits', '0 */6 * * *', 'SELECT net.http_post(''https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/auto-expire-commits'', ''{}''::jsonb);');
   ```

### Edge Function Benefits

- **Server-side validation** - Enhanced security for commit operations
- **Auto-expire functionality** - Automatic refunds and relisting after 48 hours
- **Audit logging** - Server-side logging of all commit operations
- **Webhook integration** - Easy integration with external services

## Current Local Fallback Features

### Commit to Sale

- ✅ Validates seller permissions
- ✅ Checks commit deadline (48 hours)
- ✅ Updates order/transaction status
- ✅ Marks books as sold
- ✅ Creates notifications for buyer and seller
- ✅ Prevents double-commits

### Decline Order (New Feature)

- ✅ Allows sellers to reject orders
- ✅ Updates status to "declined_by_seller"
- ✅ Notifies buyer of declined order
- ✅ Requires confirmation before declining
- ✅ Cannot be undone once confirmed

### Error Handling

- ✅ Graceful fallback when Edge Functions unavailable
- ✅ Clear error messages for users
- ✅ Proper loading states during operations
- ✅ Automatic retry mechanisms

## Testing the System

### In QA Dashboard (Admin Panel)

1. Go to Admin Dashboard → QA Testing
2. Create demo orders
3. Test both commit and decline functionality
4. Verify notifications are created

### Manual Testing

1. Create an order as a buyer
2. Log in as the seller
3. Go to User Profile → Activity tab
4. See pending commits
5. Test both "Commit to Sale" and "Decline Order" buttons

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot reach commit function" Error

- **Solution**: The system now automatically falls back to local functionality
- **Result**: Commit operations will still work perfectly

### Edge Functions Not Working

- **Check**: Supabase project has Edge Functions enabled
- **Verify**: Environment variables are set correctly
- **Test**: Use QA Dashboard to test functions directly

### Database Tables Missing

The system gracefully handles missing tables:

- Tries `transactions` table first
- Falls back to `orders` table
- Shows appropriate error messages if neither exists

## Support

The commit system is now fully functional without requiring Edge Functions deployment. The local fallback provides all essential functionality with proper error handling and user feedback.
